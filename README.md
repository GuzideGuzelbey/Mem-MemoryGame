# MemoryGame

Instructions Given by the Mentors

You joined an online game platform startup and your task is to build one of the small classic games.

You will build a Memory Game, where a user needs to flip all the cards in a game in pairs until they find all the matching pairs. You aspire to make the game smooth and pleasant, so the user is compelled to spend more time playing it.
